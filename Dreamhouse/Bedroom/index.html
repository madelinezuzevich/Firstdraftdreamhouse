    <p>The bedroom is a very special room. Mother brushes the carpet and beats the pillows, and father pulls down his pants each night. In late fall—in the afternoon—mother sometimes opens the windows and takes a nap. It often makes her sick—the cold and the brushing and the beating. At night, the children pray with their parents. Everyone—all four get on their knees and say things like Our Father.<p>
