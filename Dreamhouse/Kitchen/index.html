     <p>Mother washes the dishes and picks her fingers at the table. The children still have food on their faces and hands, they chase each other downstairs.  There’s a large bump, something fell, and the little girl is screaming and crying. Mother doesn’t hear, she’s thinking of going to the grocery store tomorrow. The little girl is screaming and crying and father is coming home late. <p>
