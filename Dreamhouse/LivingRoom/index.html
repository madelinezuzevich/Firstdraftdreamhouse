      <p>Father rests in his armchair. He watches the color TV and mother’s patterned dress fold in between her legs. She’s vacuuming. She looks so pretty, he thinks. He left crumbs on the floor, and then there’s the dust. She vacuums every day and there’s still dust. The children are in the backyard, picking up worms from under the deck. The house feels still after sunset. It’s nice to have a girl around the house, he thinks.
